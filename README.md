# School_District_Analysis

## Overview

I will be analyzing data on student funding and students' standardized test scores using Pandas.

## Results
Discoveries:
- Student population is mainly 10th graders
- Average scores are 72.3 (reading score) and 64.6 (math score).
- Students attending schools with budgets exceeding 956,438 are more likely to score within the 75th percentile for both math (76) and reading (84).
- Public schools (911,196) received more funding than Charter schools (872,626)
- Despite less funding, students attending Charter schools were more likely to have higher grades than students attending public school

Based on the data, funding may not be the reason why students attending Charter schools have higher grades. There could be another factor like class size that could impact students' test scores.

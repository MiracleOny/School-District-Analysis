# School District Analysis

## Overview
The chief data scientist for a city school district has gotten a new version of student data with several changes. This includes an additional column: "school budget". I will analyze data on student funding and students' standardized (math and reading) test scores and present trends in school performance.

## Results
Discoveries:
- Student population is mainly 10th graders
- Average scores are 72.3 (reading score) and 64.6 (math score).
- Students attending schools with budgets exceeding 956,438 are more likely to score within the 75th percentile for both math (76) and reading (84).
- Public schools (911,196) received more funding than Charter schools (872,626)
- Despite less funding, students attending Charter schools were more likely to have higher math scores than students attending public school
- For reading scores, students attending public school were more likely to score higher than students attending charter schools

## Summary
Based on the data, funding may not be the reason why there are discrepencies between students in charter and public schools. Rather, differences could be a results of class size, funding allocations, access to additional resources, and number of hours spent in class. Future research should focus on identifying how funding is allocated and other factors that may impact student test scores.
